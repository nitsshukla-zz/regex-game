# High level
1) Have a question bank
2) Every question to have a lot of test-cases to run against.
3) If failed, we can show the 1st test-case failed.
4) Need a strategy for finding the best answer: people who write longer regex are most likely giving bad solution.
5) This will mostly use firebase to converse
6) People can have infinite score, as long as we keep challenging people
7) Leaderboard is required to keep people motivated
